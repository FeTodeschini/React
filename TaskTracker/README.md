This Repository contains the code for the "TaskTracker App". It is just a demo for showing the author's knowledge about React.

For runnning the App, simply:

- Clone the repository
- Make sure you have node.js installed
- From a terminal (I use the one from Visual Code"), run the command below from the App's root folder:
    npm start
- Check the App in your browser (http://localhost:3000)

You can:

- Add a new task by typing the details in the input boxes and clicking "Save task"
- Remove a task by clicking the red "X"
- Enable/disable the task reminder by dounle-clicking it
- Hide/Show the "Add Task panel" by clicking on "Close/Add"
